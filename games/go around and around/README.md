**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
 It’s like Celeste meets Outer Wilds, but with time-limited reincarnation and a world connected upside-down world, and the predecessors.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
**Visions** are projections of some of what happened to the predecessors, revealing some of the mystery and putting together the puzzle pieces.
The opening between the worlds allows you to move around and see the upside-down world.
**Rewinding time** is for a short period to avoid mistakes and discover more before the end but it makes the body fade over time.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
Explore the world, remnants of past chosen ones, and hidden pathways. Use **Past Vision** to witness echoes of previous seekers and learn about what happened and their steps.
Interact with Both Worlds by solving puzzles that bridge the realms, unlocking memories, and altering fate. Make Choices before using a time reset—each attempt provides new insight but brings the hero closer to fading away.
Reach the Endgame and restore the original state before running out of attempts, leading to different outcomes based on how much was discovered.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
The ambiguous beginning that does not explain much about the world or the main character makes it ambiguous and you play to discover the nature of this world and the upside-down world The quality and difficulty of the puzzles is good, but they can be solved to find keys around the place, in addition to the Scenes, which are the visions of the ancestors chosen for this before. The scope of the game is it focuses on a small area of the two worlds, but it has many mysteries and stories around it. Mystery and suspense is the main thing to complete the game.
